## Definition of Done (global)

* All flows work without page refresh (Turbo/Stimulus/fetch).
* Server key never exposed; uploads use direct S3; signed URLs are short-lived.
* Errors are actionable, not generic.
* Telemetry: generation duration, success rate, credit consumption, and per-size render time captured.
* Basic unit + request specs for upload, generation, and streaming; happy-path Cypress (or Playwright) for end-to-end.

If helpful, I can convert this into a CSV or Jira importable JSON, or expand any epic into detailed tasks (UX, backend, Stimulus controllers, ActionCable/Turbo Streams wiring).
